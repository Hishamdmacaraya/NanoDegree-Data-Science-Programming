    "Hello and welcome to this course on learning \"What is Programming\"! In this course, we're going to be looking at words, terms, and concepts in the worlds of web technology and programming. This course isn't going to dive into the nitty gritty details of how a web request is converted to bits and sent across the wire as electrical pulses...and that level of detail of explanation is already significantly more complicated and low-level than we'll be diving!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll be looking at five main sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web Languages\n",
    "* Programming\n",
    "* Standards\n",
    "* Version Control\n",
    "* Disparate Web Terms\n",

    "The web is a wide and varied place. Many people spend their entire careers in the world of web development. So in this section, we'll be looking at:\n",
    "\n",
    "* front end vs back end\n",
    "* Front-end languages\n",
    "* Back-end languages\n",
    "* Programming\n",
    "The notion of \"programming\" can be a little cryptic if you haven't ever done it before. What exactly does a programmer _do_? How does one become a programmer? In this section, we'll look at:\n",

    "Syntax\n",
    "Text Editors\n",
    "Programming\n",
    "Estimating how long it takes to \"program\"\n",
    "Standards\n",
    "Where do programming languages come from? How are they developed? What in the world is a \"spec\"? We'll look at these questions and others in the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "How HTML and CSS are developed\n",
    "How JavaScript is developed\n",
    "How Python is developed\n",
    "Version Control\n",
    "Version Control is incredibly powerful and is used by any programmer that's worth their weight. In the following sections, we'll look at what Version control is, how it works, and other parts of the version control ecosystem. The topics in this section are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Version Control is needed\n",
    "How Version Control works\n",

    "What a PR is\n",
    "Disparate Web Terms\n",
    "The web is a huge place, and not everything fits neatly into the \"front end\" or the \"back end\". There are terms that span both or terms that are tangentially related. In this section on \"Disparate Web Terms\", we'll be looking at terms and concepts that are in the world of web development but don't fit cleanly in \"front end\", \"back end\", or \"version control\". The topics in this section are:\n",
